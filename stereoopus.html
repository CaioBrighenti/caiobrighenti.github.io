									<p>Pudge Wars was a long term project where I co-led a team in the development of an add-on for the popular PC game Dota 2. Pudge Wars was an adaption and remake of a highly popular Warcraft 3 addon with the same name. I was not involved with nor do I take credit for the original Warcraft 3 mod. The official Steam Workshop page for the my Pudge Wars project <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296831818"> can be seen here</a>. The project became very successful, boasting over 1,700,000 ratings on Steam, and over 5,200,000 unique subscribers. Pudge Wars has been featured on several different mediums, including in Valve's official custom games <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kqap9-NWD8?t=46">announcement video</a>. </p>

									<p>Our team consisted of four people, including two programmers, one 3D map developer, and one digital artist. My role was centered around development and programming, as well as managing the project's outwards image and marketing. The project was implemented using <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/Scripting/API">Dota 2's Scripting API</a>. While Dota 2 now features official developmental tools, the majority of this project was accomplished before these tools were implemented. This was accomplished by reverse engineering Dota's single pre-existing add-on at the time, <a href="http://www.dota2.com/wraithnight/"> Frostivus</a>. The coding was done almost entirely in Lua, with the exception of user interface development, UI development used Dota's <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/Panorama">Panorama</a> UI framework, which in turn uses HTML5,CSS and JS. The source code can be seen at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Aderum/pudgewars-workshop/overview">our Bitbucket repository.</a></p>
                                    <p>The largest challenge of this project was working concurrently in a team with people from across the world, as project members were located in Brazil, Sweden, Poland, and New Zealand. This collaborative effort forced me to drastically improve my teamwork and communicaiton skills. Git became a critical aspect of our project management, and I gained significant experience with it. This project also pushed me to be creative and experiment, as we were working with an almost entirely unexplored and poorly documented API. Accomplishing anything required trial and error, as well as sharing insights with other developers facing the same issues. </p>
