                                    <p>The Virtual Galapagos project is a concerted effort by a small team consisting of myself, a professor at Colgate, a member of Colgate’s instructional design team, and two other undergraduate students. Our primary objective is to design a way for children around the world to learn about science while using the Galapagos Islands as motivation. Our core philosophy is that the science should be digestible, without being presented as overly simplistic, and that students should be able to choose their own path, thus taking agency in their learning. We are currently developing a pilot of this program in the form of a 3D application for computers as well as mobile devices featuring virtual reality elements.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This project began in the summer of 2017, when I spent 10 weeks on the Colgate campus working on this project. This included a 10-day trip to the Galapagos, where I collected 168 different shots of 360° video utilizing two Go-Pro camera rigs. Through this experience, I gained great familiarity with working with 360° video and the nuances of stitching six different shots together into a single 360° shot using Kolor Autopano Video Pro. This project has continued on into the semester, and serves now as my on-campus employment. I am the main developer of this project, directly implementing the vision by leading a small team of myself and one more undergraduate student. I also lead the user experience design for this project. I am working with the Unity3D engine for this project, utilizing the SteamVR and Google VR SDKs. I am responsible for all in-engine development. All programming is done with the C# programming language. This project is not open source.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This project continues to allow me to acquire new skills while further developing existing ones. I have become more proficient with the Unity3D engine, especially in terms of virtual reality development. Despite having no prior experience with 360° video, I am now very familiar with the process of shooting, and later processing, 360° video. Below is an example of a shot I filmed while in the Galapagos. I have also further developed my design skills, as this project has been designed from the ground up by our team with our core philosophy as the focus.
                                    </p>
